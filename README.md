# 💫 About Me
As a fourth year data science student at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), I have gained experience in data analysis, database development, machine learning, and network programming, developing practical skills in Python, Java, and SQL. These experiences have shaped my interest in the broader applications of data science, especially in cybersecurity as I am pursuing a cybersecurity master.

My bachelor thesis focuses on investigating the asymmetry in causal interactions between brain regions during epileptic seizures. Entering a new research area, I conducted data preprocessing, analysis, and visualisation in Python for the large dataset.  After completing the thesis, I continued exploring the data on my own using Graph Neural Networks, reflecting my self driven approach to learning and experimentation. 

Looking ahead, I am expanding my skills in machine learning with the goal of applying data science across different areas; and I am currently taking additional ML/DL courses to deepen this direction. I am particularly interested in analysing data and I have also experience with data engineering in Azure. With a combination of technical skills, analytical thinking, and self driven learning, I am confident about my ability to support and enhance data-driven projects.
